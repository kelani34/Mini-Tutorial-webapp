                      <h2 class="w3-card">How I started coding.</h2>
                      <p>I started coding three years ago. I was so facinated when I started coding, though I stumbled on  obstacles and I  felt like I should'nt code anymore. I never gave up I kept on practicing. And also, I felt lazy at a point but I had to encourage myself to do more, so today I want to encourage you to start coding today. <b>I love {<\>}ing </b> </p>
                      <h3 class="w3-card">How to start coding today!</h3>
                      <p>Already have your mind set on becoming a developer? Then there's probably one question on your mind: how to start coding? It can be daunting to compete with professionals, but we all have to start somewhere.And don't worry if you don't yet know anything: if you’re struggling to tell your PHP from your JavaScripts, or web hosting from domain names, this is the perfect tutorial for you.</p>
                      <h2 class="w3-card">Why Learn Web Development Anyway? </h2>
                      <p>If you just happen to land in this tutorial without even planning to learn how to start coding right now, here are a few reasons why you should start thinking about it: Coding is a skill that is in high demand in the technology industry.Freelancer jobs as a coder can allow you to work wherever you want. All you need is a computer and the internet! But most of the time, you will be working with a team who can help you develop your skills.If you want to get into cutting-edge job fields that are currently available it is a perfect motivation for how to start coding because this kind of knowledge is very much needed.Many of the most exciting opportunities in emerging industries today are in the cryptocurrency and AI space. Coding is crucial for both.Coding is both challenging and worthwhile. You’ll be amazed at what you’re able to create after just a small-time spent on how to start learning coding.The skills you learn will be relevant in the future. The tech industry is only going to grow!Jobs that use specialist skills like coding are often very well paid.You don’t need a degree to learn how to code. You can get started without any college/university debt!</p>

                        <h2 class="w3-card">Programming for Beginners</h2>
                        <p>In the beginning, coding is going to be tough – you are essentially learning a new language to communicate ideas in! There is no easy way how to start programming for beginners.If you’re completely new to this sort of stuff, it will be nothing like anything you have done previously. Stick with it though. The longer you hang in there, the more likely you are to have a “eureka” moment and it will all start making sense.You should start by choosing the programming language that seems most fitting for you. It is advised to choose a language that is mostly user-friendly or is not that hard to begin with.</p>
                        <p>An example of that would be HTML or CSS, which are mainly used for basic web applications. If you are looking at more serious programming languages to start with, Python could be the one for you.Above all, coding is about problem-solving. It’s not so much about memorizing all these functions that different lines of code create (although that’s incredibly useful). You can look at those functions up if you forget how to do something specific! Your skills as a problem solver, which are the most important skills regarding coding, will develop with the more time you spend training them. </p>
                        <h2 class="w3-card">How to Start Coding – The Wider Concepts</h2>
                        <p>Whether it would be creating a mobile app or a dating website, computer science and coding might seem like alien skills that are impossible to understand. Even if you’re already familiar with how networks and computer systems work, it’s still a good idea to give yourself a quick recap from the list below. When learning programming, there are several things that you should fully understand: </p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>Learn computer science basics for beginners. There are loads of great resources out there. Before you start searching where to start coding, you need a solid idea of how computers function! </li>
                          <li>Understand how networks work. It’s important to know how different computers can communicate with one another in various types of networks. This will make it easier to understand the concepts that are introduced later. </li>
                          <li>Familiarise yourself with the command line. Here’s where you’ll finally start to feel like you are getting to know how to start coding! Entering text into the command line can be a bit scary at first but you don’t need to fear. It’s very difficult to do any real damage!  </li>
                          <li>Next, it’s important to know how to start building a website and get a domain. This stuff isn’t going to challenge you too much, but it is crucial in your journey to becoming a web developer.  </li>
                        </ol>
                        <h2 class="w3-card">Client-Side Front-End</h2>

                        <p>Every page you visit on the internet is built using certain programs that work side by side with each other. The browser you use is the translator that translates the code that is built either by the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.As a result, we see the result on our screen and interact with it along the way. There are three main front-end languages:</p>

                            <h3>HTML</h3>
                        </header>

                        <div class="w3-container">
                          <p>If you’ve never done any web development whatsoever, you’re going to want to start with HTML. </p>
                          <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. Put simply, it’s used to make basic webpages. It’s not technically a programming language at all. However, if you’re completely new to coding, it’s still nothing like any language you’ll be familiar with. </p>
                          <p>Whenever you see images or text on the web, they will have been put there primarily using HTML. HTML allows you to place text, images, videos, songs, and other content onto a webpage using what are called “tags”. </p>
                          <p>There isn’t a whole lot you can do with HTML but what you can do appears all over the internet. It’s therefore really important to get a good grasp of HTML before you get to know how to start coding career or hobby as a web developer. </p>

                            <p>The next logical step to learning how to develop websites is to learn CSS. This still isn’t a programming language though! However, it does introduce a load more variety into your websites and is another crucial step you need to take before you start programming in more interesting languages!</p>
                            <p>CSS makes the stuff you made using HTML look good. You can do all kinds of neat tricks with it such as adding color, padding (borders), margins, and changing fonts.</p>
                            <p>A good grasp of CSS and HTML can make a half-decent looking website. However, if you want to be a developer, you’re going to have to learn some real programming languages too!  </p>

If you want to learn how to start coding to a high level, you’re going to need a good knowledge of JavaScript. </p>
                            <p>When learning programming, JavaScript is a must. It’s everywhere. These days, you’ll be hard-pressed to find a company that doesn’t want some kind of online presence. JavaScript will be used to build most of their applications and websites. </p>
                            <p>Being such a widely-used programming language, job opportunities are great for someone skilled at programming in JavaScript. That said, in a recent survey of developers by StackOverflow, it was found that a massive 62.5% of respondents said that they used it. </p>
                            <p>This means that finding a JavaScript job is going to be hugely competitive too. Although the path of how to start coding can be tough it will be worth it though. PayScale estimates that the average salary of a JavaScript web developer is almost $60,000. There’s lots of money to be made if you’re good!</p>
                            <p>JavaScript adds interactive features to your list of web developer tools. These might be games or responses to the text being entered – that kind of thing. </p>
                            <p>You can start by making small adjustments to your basic HTML webpages. These can include welcome messages and image changes. However, you can progress to making full three-dimensional games if you get good enough at coding in JavaScript! </p>
